# Infant-Danger-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project is designed to track the movements of an infant in a room using a webcam. The system allows you to select the infant using a rectangular box and mark dangerous areas in the room, such as switch boxes. If the infant moves near a marked danger zone, the system will alert the parents by playing a warning sound or voice alert.
